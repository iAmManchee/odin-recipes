        <h1>Apricot Tartlets from Dishonored</h1>

        <p>
            Dishonored, due to the rather dark climate of Dunwall and the prevailing plague, does not 
            spoil its citizens with the menu. Whale meat packed in cans under rather unsterile 
            conditions, Pratchett Jellied Eels, and especially the idea of ​​baking rats spreading the 
            plague may seem like unappetizing kitchen ventures. Fortunately, Corvo Attano traverses 
            not only those neglected, dark corners of the city, but also has the opportunity to 
            appear at the Boyle Mansion or the Golden Cat, where you can find more refined dishes, 
            including apricot tartlets. The game doesn’t spoil any clues for exact ingredients of this mini tart 
            so we just tried to use a traditional combination – pastry with almonds, sweet custard 
            made of mascarpone and finally pieces of ripe apricots.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>For the dough..</p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>3/4 glass wheat flour</li>
            <li>45g powdered sugar</li>
            <li>45g butter</li>
            <li>40g almonds</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Cold water</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>For the filling..</p>
        <ul>
            <li>200g apricots</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>30g sugar</li>
            <li>125g mascarpone cheese or cream cheese</li>
            <li>Lemon peel</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If you have whole almonds, you must grind them finely in a blender. Then put the 
                almond powder into the bowl, add flour, sugar and salt and throw cold butter. Chop 
                everything with a knife, and then quickly rub the clumps in your fingers (too long 
                kneading of the dough with your hands warms them and the dough will lose its desired 
                consistency – alternatively you can make it with a kitchen robot). When the mixture 
                forms into a kind of a wet sand, pour 1 tablespoon of cold water and knead the dough 
                quickly to obtain a smooth mass. If the dough is still poorly connected, add another 
                tablespoon of water and knead. Form dough into a ball, wrap with foil and cool in the 
                refrigerator for about half an hour.</li>
            <li>Spread the tins with butter or oil, sprinkle with flour and remove its excess, 
                turning them upside down and hitting their bottoms over the sink.</li>
            <li>Set oven before rolling the dough – for 200°C/392°F, up and down heater option.</li>
            <li>Place the chilled pastry on a baking tray or baking paper sprinkled with a flour and 
                roll it to a thickness of approx. 3mm (you can also roll it through a second sheet of 
                paper). Then cut circles out of the dough – they should be 2 cm larger than the 
                diameter of the tins for the tartlet. Put the dough onto the tins and press them with 
                your fingers to the bottom and sides. Cut off the excess on the sides, pressing the 
                molds with the palm from the top. At the end, prick the dough with a fork. If you 
                want, you can put a piece of baking paper and dry rice or beans on top – to be sure 
                that dough will be even on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Put tins with the dough into the oven and bake it until lightly browned about 10 
                minutes. During this time, we are going to make next two steps.</li>
            <li>Wash the fruit, cut in half, pull out the seeds and cut into quarters.</li>
            <li>Crack egg into a bowl, add sugar and mix together for 1 minute. Then add mascarpone 
                cheese and mix again to obtain a smooth custard without lumps.</li>
            <li>Put out the baked tartlets from the oven and lower the temperature to 180°C/356°F. Pour into 
                molds about 1 or 2 tablespoons of cheese custard (up to the height of the dough) and put two 
                quarters of apricots on top – remember not to put too much cheese custard because the 
                apricot will slightly raise its level.</li>
            <li>Put tartlets carefully into the oven and bake for about 15 minutes until the cheese 
                custard is solid and lightly browned.</li>
            <li>After baking, take out tartlets from the oven and leave to cool. It is worth chilling 
                them for about 20 minutes in the refrigerator (necessarily under cover). Remember to 
                pull out tartlets from the mold before serving.</li>
        </ul>
