        <p>
            Honey Nut Treat is the perfect quintessence of the simplicity of Skyrim cuisine – 
            nuts in various forms, honey and cereals. Simple, nutritious and tasty at the same time.
             Maybe the appearance leaves a lot to be desired (visual associations are probably obvious
             ) – but it do tastes great. You do not necessarily have to place balls on a stick, it’s 
             enough to form them to the size of standard pralines and serve them on a plate. 
             Dovahkiins recommends it for dessert!

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>40g mixture of walnuts, hazelnuts, cashews</li>
            <li>30g unsalted peanuts</li>
            <li>60g oatmeal</li>
            <li>75g honey</li>
            <li>60g peanut butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cut nuts roughly into smaller pieces – walnuts into quarters, hazelnuts and cashews 
                in half.</li>
            <li>Add honey and peanut butter to the saucepan. Heat on low power for about 1 minute, 
                stirring constantly. When the mass becomes smooth and combined, turn off the 
                heater.</li>
            <li>Put nuts, peeled peanuts and oatmeal into a warm honey mass. Mix everything thoroughly. 
                When the mixture has cooled down a little, put it under the cover for 30 minutes in 
                the fridge.</li>
            <li>Take mass out of the fridge and form balls of various sizes, which should be put on 
                sticks. Chill them in the fridge.</li>
            <li>Remove Honey Nut Treat from the fridge about 30 minutes before serving. It goes well 
                with a mug of dark, bitter beer.</li>
        </ul>
