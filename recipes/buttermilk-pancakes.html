        <h1>Hungry Jim's Buttermilk Pancakes from Days Gone</h1>
        <img src="../images/days-gone-1-pancakes-hungry-jims-8.jpg">
        <p>At the beginning, I thought that in Days Gone we won’t find many culinary elements. 
            However, the food motif is implemented not only in the mechanics of hunting, collecting 
            plants and taking them to nearby camps (more on this in the next post, where we will cook 
            some venison;)), but also appears in the environment creation layer. A great example here 
            is the Hungry Jim’s diner, which we see at the very beginning of the mission “It;s not 
            safe here” at Marion Forks. The camera draws our attention to the unusual advertising of 
            the restaurant – it is a few-foot tall figure of a lumberjack resting his hand on a pile 
            of pancakes topped with sauce. For this we made delicious homemade salted caramel, which 
            has a similar color to the sauce shown on the giant advertisement.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>300g buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>60g melted butter</li>
            <li>160g wheat flour</li>
            <li>30g sugar</li>
            <li>1.5 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            <li>100ml 30% cream</li>
            <li>100g sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Melt butter in a saucepan and cool it slightly.</li>
            <li>Pour dry ingredients into a larger bowl, mix and make a hole in the middle (like a 
                bomb hole;))</li>
            <li>Pour buttermilk into a smaller bowl (it should be at room temperature) and melted 
                butter. Separate the yolks from the whites – translate the yolks into buttermilk, and 
                the whites into a separate bowl. Whisk the whites lightly with a fork.</li>
            <li>Pour the wet ingredients into to the bowl with dry ingredients, directly to the hole. 
                Mix with a spoon only to combine the ingredients. At the end, add whisked whites and 
                mix again with a few delicate movements. Do not stir too long – you can leave clumps 
                in the batter.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with dough and let it “rest” for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour the sugar into a pan with a light and thick bottom. Heat on medium heat. When it 
                dissolves, reduce the fire to a minimum and control the color of the caramel. At this 
                stage, be careful not to burn sugar. When the color is intensely amber, add heated 
                cream. Mix it with a wooden spatula and heat at medium power for about 15 minutes. 
                Dense clumps of sugar should dissolve and the final consistency should resemble 
                liquid honey (after cooling, the sauce thickens – if it’s too thick, you can add more 
                cream). At the end add some salt.</li>
            <li>Firmly heat the pan, add a bit of butter. Using a ladle, apply a portion of a dough 
                into the center, spread lightly on the sides so that the pancakes are round. Fry on 
                strong fire for 3-4 minutes, until the cake will grow slightly and bubbles will start 
                to appear on its surface. Then turn pancakes over with the spatula and fry for a 
                further 3 minutes. Pancakes must be nicely browned on two sides. Put them on a plate, 
                stacking one on top of the other.</li>
            <li>Pour the hot pancakes with liquid, salted caramel. Better eat them fast before the 
                freakers will come and devour them!</li>
        </ul>
